# Private Files

This directory exists, but its contents (except for folder structure) are ignored by Git. This is so private and
sensitive configuration files can be stored here, referenced by deployment scripts and projects, without getting
committed by accident.

Note that deployments to certain environments will fail without the necessary private configuration files.
